# PEX

Parasitic Extraction (PEX) is a critical step in analog IC design that occurs **after layout** and **before final verification/tapeout**. It models the unintended resistive and capacitive effects introduced by routing, device placement, and proximity in silicon.

In analog circuits — especially precision blocks like **folded cascode OTAs** — these parasitics significantly affect performance, making PEX-based simulations essential.

## Why Do We Need PEX?

| Reason                          | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance Degradation**     | Parasitic capacitance reduces bandwidth and phase margin.                   |
| **Offset and Mismatch Effects** | Parasitic coupling causes imbalance in differential paths.                  |
| **Stability Impact**            | Additional phase lag from parasitics can destabilize feedback loops.        |
| **Post-Layout Verification**    | Confirms that layout did not violate design intent (gain, UGB, PSRR, etc.). |
| **Tapeout Confidence**          | Ensures high correlation between simulation and silicon behavior.           |





For a folded cascode OTA, RC + CC extraction is essential. It ensures layout-induced degradation is captured early in simulation, enabling confident tapeout. Neglecting coupling capacitance or interconnect resistance can lead to significant performance loss or instability in silicon.

## PEX using Klayout-PEX tool

IIC-OSIC-Tools comes with pre-installed tool called as **K-pex**. The current status of [KLayout-PEX](https://martinjankoehler.github.io/klayout-pex-website/doc/doc.html#sec-into-klayout-pex-prototype-status) says as following:

Available KLayout PEX Engines:

| **Engine**         | **PEX Type** | **Status**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `KPEX/MAGIC`       | CC, RC       | Usable                  | Wrapper engine, using installed `magic` tool                                     |
| `KPEX/FasterCap`   | CC           | Usable, *pending QA*    | Field solver engine using `FasterCap`                                            |

| `KPEX/2.5D`        | CC           | Under construction      | Prototype engine implementing MAGIC concepts/formulas with `KLayout` means       |
| `KPEX/2.5D`        | R, RC        | Planned                 | Prototype engine implementing MAGIC concepts/formulas with `KLayout` means       |


## Running the [`KPEX/MAGIC` Engine](https://iic-jku.github.io/klayout-pex-website/doc/doc.html#sec-kpex-magic)


The magic section of `kpex --help` describes the arguments and their defaults. Important arguments:

- `--magicrc`: specify location of the `magicrc` file  
- `--gds`: path to the GDS input layout  
- `--magic`: enable magic engine

### Example Command


```bash
kpex --pdk ihp_sg13g2 --magic --gds GDS_PATH --out_dir OUTPUT_DIR_PATH
```  
more to kpex can be found under the command `kpex --help`

```bash
`kpex --help` command gives us the complete list of useful commands in order to understand the usage of KPEX
```
Once PEX is succesfully done, the extracted netlist SPICE file will be generated in the provided output path, which consists of extracted parasitics which can be further used to do post layout simulations and verify whether the design layout satisfies the design specifications or not.


## Observations and Practical Results

During this work, the 2025.05 Docker release of IIC-OSIC-Tools was used, since the design was submitted on 21 August 2025, and subsequent debugging was performed in that version.
When running the FasterCap engine, the process executed successfully; however, the generated `.pex.spice` file was empty, indicating that no valid parasitic data were written.
Conversely, when using the MAGIC engine, a `.pex.spice` file was generated but contained improperly scaled parameters, leading to simulation inconsistencies.


Upon investigation of the official [IIC-OSIC-Tools release notes](), it was confirmed that in the `2025.07` update, the developers temporarily removed klayout-pex due to incompatibility with several dependencies. 

This subsequent removal confirms that the encountered issues in the 2025.05 environment were indeed genuine tool-level compatibility problems, not user-level errors.
Therefore, for this design, PEX-based post-layout simulations were omitted, and circuit validation was based on pre-layout verification complemented by manual parasitic estimation from layout dimensions.
