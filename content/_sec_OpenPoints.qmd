# Circuit design ettiquettes

In a well-done design, the documentation is included in the schematic/source code, so there is no searching for a piece
of documentation somewhere else (which is often not found anyway). 

A detailed discussion about etiqquetes to be followed for **Pins**, **Schematics**, **Symbols**, **Mixed-Signals
designs**, can be found
[here](https://iic-jku.github.io/analog-circuit-design/analog_circuit_design.html#sec-designers-etiquette)
