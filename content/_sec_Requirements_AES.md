# AES Requirements

 
A switch-mode LED driver IC needs to be designed to operate within an 18–36 V input range, support high-resolution (16-bit) PWM dimming for at least four RGBW channels with adjustable current control (1–40 mA), integrate protection features (ESD, over/under-voltage, over-temperature), and enable robust data communication with upstream and downstream ICs. The IC must also include an internal oscillator (≥25 MHz), internal generation of data line supply (3–5 VDC), and advanced diagnostics such as LED error detection.

# Topology Selection:

To meet the defined performance and protection requirements efficiently, a buck converter topology has been selected for the LED driver IC. This choice is based on the analysis and recommendations from Bernhard Wicht’s 2020 paper **Analog Building Blocks for DC-DC Converters,** @wicht2020 which highlights the buck converter as a suitable and energy-efficient architecture for step-down voltage regulation in integrated power management systems. Given the input voltage range of 18–36 V and the need for tightly regulated current control per channel (1–40 mA), the buck converter enables high efficiency and compact implementation. Its compatibility with mixed-signal integration and the ability to support precise current regulation and fast transient response makes it well aligned with the requirements of our LED driver IC, particularly in ensuring reliable performance across varying input conditions and thermal loads.
