abstract: |
  This master's thesis is part of the AES-Campus project, which main objective is to extend the open source toolchain of
  Prof. Pretl's IIC-OSIC-TOOLS with the IHP OpenPDK SG13G2 in such a way that AES GmbH as an SME can use this toolchain
  for future product design. To verify this, an LED driver for AES GmbH's LED lighting systems will be designed together
  with HSB and AES GmbH under the motto "Just do it!"

  In addition to the technical challenges, such as adapting the 3V to 5V environment of the LED driver to the 18V to 36V
  of the aircraft cabin power supply, and seat-specific individual control and adjustment, another goal of the project
  is to develop suitable cooperation structures that enable a wide variety of people to work together efficiently and
  effectively.
