# Thesis Focus

The focus of our thesis is designing and implementating error amplifier block within the selected buck converter
topology using Open Source Tools. This involves developing the block from initial specification and schematic design
through to layout, verification (including LVS and PEX), and final tapeout using exclusively open-source tools and
IHP-SG13G2 PDK. The goal is to create a high-performance, low-power error amplifier tailored to the requirements of the
mixed-signal LED driver IC, ensuring accurate regulation and stability of the control loop. This work will contribute a
critical building block to the overall ASIC design while also serving as a case study in open-source analog IC design
workflows.

## Title: Development and Tapeout of an Analog Error Amplifier for LED Driver Control Using Open-Source Tools

This thesis presents the end-to-end custom IC design of a folded cascode error amplifier for integration within a
voltage-mode buck converter-based LED driver IC. Targeting a 130nm CMOS process (IHP SG13G2), the project covers
schematic design, simulation, layout, and physical verification using fully open-source tools provided by the IIC-OSIC
ecosystem. The amplifier is tailored to meet the feedback stability and performance specifications of the LED driver
system operating within a 5 V output and 18–36 V input range.








In the section detailing buck converter control design (especially the voltage-mode control loop), @wicht2020 focuses
on: 

- A transconductance amplifier used as the error amplifier

- High open-loop gain

- A clear emphasis on stability, bandwidth, and linear range

- In most cases, the paper assumes low voltage (3.3V analog supply) domain

- The architectures shown are two-stage OTAs or folded cascode for high PSRR

Final Take:

Folded Cascode OTA is very much aligned with @wicht2020 methodology, especially if our focus is on:

- A high-gain, linear, feedback-stage amplifier

- Working within 3.3V analog domain

- Dealing with moderate capacitive loads (e.g. compensation network / VCOMP node)

- @wicht2020 doesn’t enforce one architecture rigidly, but the characteristics described match folded cascode best.

### Design Process Overview

![Design Process Flow](figures/IMP.png)

1. **Literature Review** – Study error amplifier architectures, compensation, and integration in PMICs  
2. **Topology Selection** – Choose folded cascode due to high gain and good output swing  
3. **Schematic Design** – Build differential input stage, current mirrors, biasing blocks  
4. **Simulation** – DC, AC, transient, noise, PVT, Monte Carlo  
5. **Layout** – Apply matching, shielding, dummy devices  
6. **LVS + DRC** – Ensure physical correctness and rule compliance  
7. **PEX + Post-Layout Sim** – Verify parasitic-aware performance  
8. **Tapeout Packaging** – Generate GDSII and tapeout documents
