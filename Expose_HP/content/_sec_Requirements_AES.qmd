# Introduction

As the demand for compact, energy-efficient electronic systems continues to grow, there is an equally strong need to make integrated circuit (IC) design more accessible and affordable. With the rise of open-source process design kits (PDKs) and toolchains, it is now possible for students, researchers, and small-scale innovators to contribute to silicon development without relying on expensive commercial EDA flows. This democratization of IC design aims to lower the barrier to entry and enable broader participation in semiconductor innovation.

This thesis focuses on the custom design and tapeout of an analog building block intended for integration within a power management IC, specifically for use in a buck converter-based LED driver. The circuit is implemented in the IHP SG13G2 130 nm CMOS process and is designed to meet stringent requirements such as gain, power efficiency, and temperature stability given by Aircraft Electro/Electronic System (AES) GmBH. This thesis work is executed using the IIC-OSIC open-source toolchain. Extensive simulation across process-voltage-temperature (PVT) corners and post-layout extraction ensures that the final GDS is reliable for multi-project wafer (MPW) tapeout. This work contributes a verified, reusable analog IP block to the growing ecosystem of open-source IC design.

# AES Requirements
 
A switch-mode LED driver IC needs to be designed to operate within an 18–36 V input range, support high-resolution
(16-bit) PWM dimming for at least four RGBW channels with adjustable current control (1–40 mA), integrate protection
features (ESD, over/under-voltage, over-temperature), and enable robust data communication with upstream and downstream
ICs. The IC must also include an internal oscillator (≥25 MHz), internal generation of data line supply (3–5 VDC), and
advanced diagnostics such as LED error detection.

## Topology Selection:

To meet the defined performance and protection requirements efficiently, a buck converter topology has been selected for
the LED driver IC. This choice is based on the analysis and recommendations from Bernhard Wicht’s 2020 paper **Analog
Building Blocks for DC-DC Converters,** @wicht2020 which highlights the buck converter as a suitable and
energy-efficient architecture for step-down voltage regulation in integrated power management systems. Given the input
voltage range of 18–36 V and the need for tightly regulated current control per channel (1–40 mA), the buck converter
enables high efficiency and compact implementation. Its compatibility with mixed-signal integration and the ability to
support precise current regulation and fast transient response makes it well aligned with the requirements of our LED
driver IC, particularly in ensuring reliable performance across varying input conditions and thermal loads.
