# Motivation
This thesis focuses on the custom design and tapeout of an analog building block intended for integration within a power management IC, specifically for use in a LED driver. The circuit is implemented in the IHP SG13G2 130 nm CMOS process and is designed to meet stringent requirements such as gain, power efficiency, and temperature stability given by Aircraft Electro/Electronic System (AES) GmBH. This thesis work is executed using the IIC-OSIC open-source toolchain. Extensive simulation across process-voltage-temperature (PVT) corners and post-layout extraction ensures that the final GDS is reliable for multi-project wafer (MPW) tapeout. This work contributes a verified, reusable analog IP block to the growing ecosystem of open-source IC design.


# Topology Selection

To meet the defined performance and protection requirements efficiently, a buck converter topology has been selected for
the LED driver IC. This choice is based on the analysis and recommendations from Bernhard Wicht’s 2020 paper **Analog
Building Blocks for DC-DC Converters** @wicht2020, which highlights the buck converter as a suitable and
energy-efficient architecture for step-down voltage regulation in integrated power management systems. Given the input
voltage range of 18–36 V and the need for tightly regulated current control per channel (1–40 mA), the buck converter
enables high efficiency and compact implementation. Its compatibility with mixed-signal integration and the ability to
support precise current regulation and fast transient response makes it well aligned with the requirements of our LED
driver IC, particularly in ensuring reliable performance across varying input conditions and thermal loads.
