# Abstract

Open-source EDA has reached a point where its practical viability for real mixed-signal IC fabrication can be examined on modern semiconductor processes. This thesis evaluates that potential through the design and tape-out of an analog block for LED-driver control using the **IHP OpenPDK SG13G2 a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS PDK** and the implementation using the **open-source IIC-OSIC-TOOLS** developed by *Prof. Pretl (JKU Linz)*

The project follows a complete analog design cycle. System requirements are derived from an ideal reference schematic of a DC-DC LED-driver PMIC, modeled following the methodology from Prof. Bernhard Wicht’s book on design of power managemant ICs. From these constraints, we design an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) intended to drive a specific load extracted from the system-level PMIC model. The electrical design is implemented in Xschem for schematic capture, Ngspice for pre-layout simulation, corner and Monte-Carlo analysis using CACE, and iterative refinement to ensure gain, UGB, phase margin, and output swing meet the load-driving requirements under process and temperature variation.

The physical design phase is performed entirely in KLayout, following industry-aligned analog layout practices: matching-aware device placement, common-centroid arrays, dummy structures, guard rings, routing strategies, density compliance, pad-frame integration, and the use of IHP-provided seal-ring and ESD p-cells. Parasitics are extracted using KLayout-PEX (KPEX), and post-layout simulations confirm the impact of capacitor/resistor parasitics on stability and dynamic response, validating the design’s robustness across PVT.

A key contribution of this work is practical verification: two tape-outs were accepted and fabricated in the **IHP Open MPW run of July 2025**. To strengthen cross-disciplinary understanding, the authors executed two complete tape-outs, one for a design of NMOS foldedcascode structure and other for PMOS foldedcascode structure, switching roles one serving as **design engineer** while the other served as **layout engineer** in the first run, and vice versa in the second. This approach revealed workflow bottlenecks, toolchain strengths, and realistic guidance for analog teams adopting open-source EDA.

The results demonstrate that a fully open-source toolchain, combined with an industry-grade SiGe BiCMOS open PDK, can reliably produce manufacturable analog ICs with predictable post-layout performance. This work serves as a practical reference for engineers, researchers, and SMEs evaluating open-source flows for mixed-signal IC development, and provides evidence that democratized, open analog IC design is not only feasible but tape-out proven.
