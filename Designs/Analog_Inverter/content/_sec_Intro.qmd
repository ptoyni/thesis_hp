# Introduction

This tutorial provides a step-by-step introduction to designing and simulating a **simple analog inverter** using the **open-source tools** hosted on the [IIC-OSIC](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS) platform, specifically with the [IHP SG13G2 PDK](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK). The analog inverter, though simple, is a crucial element in analog and mixed-signal circuit design, offering valuable insights into device behavior, biasing, and small-signal performance. The goal of this tutorial is to prrovide a concise overview of the steps needed to create and verify simple CMOS circuits and systems.
